# LCRR_Database
Database created for the City of Clever, to inventory water pipes

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a simple Python program that could quickly and efficiently inventory water lines within the city. 

# Functions
The project allows for the input of customer name, address, and pipe material which is then uploaded to a private MongoDB collection that can easily be queried to narrow down addresses with lead water lines.

# Future
While the project is simple, the ability to edit existing queries is necessary; as the most likely method of uploading to the database will be through a CSV spreadsheet rather than individual entries.
